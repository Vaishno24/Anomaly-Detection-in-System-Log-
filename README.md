# Anomaly-Detection-in-System-Log-

# Introduction
This project focuses on utilizing machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms for anomaly detection in system logs, addressing the critical need for maintaining system integrity and performance.

# Project Overview
Objective: To implement and compare various ML and DL techniques for efficient and accurate anomaly detection within system logs, highlighting their effectiveness in identifying irregular patterns that deviate from the norm.
Methods: The approach includes preprocessing and encoding of log data, feature extraction using BERT and sentence tokenizer, and application of algorithms like SVM, RNN, LSTM, and CNN to classify data as normal or anomalous.
Results: Demonstrated the capacity of these algorithms to handle large datasets with high accuracy, leveraging techniques like SMOTE for handling imbalanced data and evaluating models based on their classification performance.
